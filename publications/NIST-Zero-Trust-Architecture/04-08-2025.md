# Zero Trust Architecture

## Objective

- Cybersecurity architecture that is based on zero trust principles\
  and designed to prevent data breaches and limit internal lateral movement.

### Basics

- Paradigm focused on resource protection and continual grant evaluation
- end-to-end approach to enterprise resource encompassing identity, credentials,\
  access management, operations, endpoints, hosting envs. and interconnecting infra.
- Restrict resources and grant minimum privileges for functionality
- Prevent unauthorized access to data and services while making access control\
  enforcement as granular as possible.
- Focus on authentication, authorization and shrinking implicit trust zones
  - Maintain availability
  - Minimize delays in authentication mechanisms
- Enforce least privileges for resource request with granular access

Requestor <-- Untrusted Zone --> Policy Decision/Enforcement Point (PDP/PEP) <-- Implicit Trust Zone --> Resource (System, Data, or Application)

#### Authentication and Authorization

1. What is the level of confidence about the subject's identity for this unique request?
2. Is access to the resource allowable given the level of confidence in the\
   subject's identity?
3. Does the device used for the request have the proper security posture?
4. Are there other factors taht should be considered and that change the \
   confidence level (e.g. time, location of subject, subject's security posture)?

- Implicit trust zone - represents an area where all the entities are trusted to\
  at least the level of the last PDP/PEP gateway
- PDP/PEP applies a set of controls so that all traffic beyond the PEP has a\
  common level of trust.
  - Cannot apply additional policies beyond its location in the flow of traffic
  - Should be specific as possible, implicit trust zone must be as small as possible

#### Tenets of Zero Trust

1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources
2. All communication is secured regardless of network location
3. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis
4. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy - including the observable\
    state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset - \
   and may include other behavioral and environmental attributes
   - Least privilege principles are applied to restrict visibility and accessibility
5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture \
   of all owned and associated assets
6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly \
   enforced before access is allowed
7. The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current\
   state of assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve\
   its security posture

#### A Zero Trust View of a Network

1. The entire enterprise private network is not considered an implicit trust zone
2. Devices on the network may not be owned or configurable by the enterprise
3. No resource is inherently trusted
4. Not all enterprise resources are on enterprise-owned infrastructure
5. Remote enterprise subjects and assets cannot fully trust their local network\
   connection
6. Assets and workflows moving between enterprise and nonenterprise infra should\
   have a consistent security policy and posture

### Logical Components of Zero Trust Architecture

#### Components

- The Policy Decision Point (PDP): The policy engine and policy administrator
- ZTA logical components use a seperate control plane for communication
- Applicaiton data is communicated on a data plane

1. Policy Engine: makes the ultimate decision to grant access to a resource\
   for a given subject. Policy engine makes and logs decisions and Policy\
   administrator executes the decision
2. Policy administrator: Establishes or shuts down the communication path\
   between a subject and a resource
3. Policy enforcement point (PEP): responsible for enabling, monitoring\
   and eventually terminating connections between a subject and an enterprise\
   resource.
4. Continous diagnostics & mitigation (CDM) system: gathers info about the\
   enterprise asset's current state and applies updates to configs and software\
   components.
5. Industry compliance system: ensures that the enterprise remains compliant\
   with any regulatory regime that it may fall under.
6. Threat intelligence feed(s): provides info from internal or external sources\
   that help the policy engine make access decisions.
7. Network and system activity logs: enterprise aggregates asset logs, network\
   traffic, resource access actions, and other events that provide real-time feedback\
   on the security posture of enterprise information systems
8. Data access policies: attributes, rules, and policies about access to resources
9. Enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI): responsible for generating and logging\
   certificates issued by the enterprise to resources, subjects, services and applications.
10. ID management system: responsible for creating, storing and managing enterprise\
    user accounts and identity records (lightweight directory access protocol \
    - LDAP server)
11. Security information and event management (SIEM) system: Collects security-centric\
    information for later analysis.

#### Variations of Zero Trust Architecture Approaches

##### ZTA Using Enhanced Identity Governance

- Uses identity of actors as the key components of policy creation
- Primary requirement for resource access is based on the access privileges granted\
  to the given subject
- often employed using an open network model or enterprise network with visitor access
- work well with cloud-based applications

##### ZTA Using Micro-Segmentation

- Places individual or groups of resources on unique network segment protected by\
  a gateway security component
- Requires an identity governance program but relies on the gateway commponents to\
  act as the PEP that shields resouces from unauthorized access and/or discovery
- the PEP components are managed and should be able to react and reconfigure as \
  needed to respond to threats or change in the workflows
- Very poor choice because of administration costs and adaption optimization

##### ZTA Using Network Infrastructure and Software Defined Perimeters

- Uses an overlay network (typically Layer 7 but can be set at lower levels)
- PA acts as the network controller taht sets up and reconfigures the network\
  based on the decisions made by the PE
- Most common deployment model is the agent/gateway
- agent and resouce gateway establish a secure channel used for communication
