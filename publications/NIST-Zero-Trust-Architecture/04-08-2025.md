# Zero Trust Architecture

## Objective

- Cybersecurity architecture that is based on zero trust principles\
  and designed to prevent data breaches and limit internal lateral movement.

### Basics

- Paradigm focused on resource protection and continual grant evaluation
- end-to-end approach to enterprise resource encompassing identity, credentials,\
  access management, operations, endpoints, hosting envs. and interconnecting infra.
- Restrict resources and grant minimum privileges for functionality
- Prevent unauthorized access to data and services while making access control\
  enforcement as granular as possible.
- Focus on authentication, authorization and shrinking implicit trust zones
  - Maintain availability
  - Minimize delays in authentication mechanisms
- Enforce least privileges for resource request with granular access

Requestor <-- Untrusted Zone --> Policy Decision/Enforcement Point (PDP/PEP) <-- Implicit Trust Zone --> Resource (System, Data, or Application)

#### Authentication and Authorization

1. What is the level of confidence about the subject's identity for this unique request?
2. Is access to the resource allowable given the level of confidence in the\
   subject's identity?
3. Does the device used for the request have the proper security posture?
4. Are there other factors taht should be considered and that change the \
   confidence level (e.g. time, location of subject, subject's security posture)?

- Implicit trust zone - represents an area where all the entities are trusted to\
  at least the level of the last PDP/PEP gateway
- PDP/PEP applies a set of controls so that all traffic beyond the PEP has a\
  common level of trust.
  - Cannot apply additional policies beyond its location in the flow of traffic
  - Should be specific as possible, implicit trust zone must be as small as possible

#### Tenets of Zero Trust

1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources
2. All communication is secured regardless of network location
3. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis
4. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy - including the observable\
    state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset - \
   and may include other behavioral and environmental attributes
   - Least privilege principles are applied to restrict visibility and accessibility
5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture \
   of all owned and associated assets
6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly \
   enforced before access is allowed
7. The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current\
   state of assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve\
   its security posture

#### A Zero Trust View of a Network

1. The entire enterprise private network is not considered an implicit trust zone
2. Devices on the network may not be owned or configurable by the enterprise
3. No resource is inherently trusted
4. Not all enterprise resources are on enterprise-owned infrastructure
5. Remote enterprise subjects and assets cannot fully trust their local network\
   connection
6. Assets and workflows moving between enterprise and nonenterprise infra should\
   have a consistent security policy and posture
