# The Nature of Cycles

## Definitions

- Pendulum: a weight suspended from a fixed point so that it can swing\
  freely back and forth under the influence of gravity.
  - Swinging back and forth between emotional or mental states,\
    thoughts or behaviours
- Secular Trend: a broad, overarching trend - either bullish (upwards)\
  or bearish (downward) - that reflects the dominant sentiment or macro\
  forces affecting markets over an extended period of time.

### Notes

- Cycles oscillate around a midpoint (or secular trend)
- Peformance is heavily influenced in the short run, among other things,\
  the involvement of people.

#### Phases of Cyclical Phenomena

1. Recovery from an excessively depressed lower extreme or "low"\
   toward the midpoint
2. The continued swing past the midpoint toward an upper extreme or "high"
3. The attainment of a high
4. The downward correction from the high back toward the midpoint or mean
5. The continuation of the downward movement past the midpoint, toward\
   a new low
6. The reaching of a low
7. Recovery from the low back toward the midpoint
8. The continuation of the upward swing past the midpoint, toward another\
   high
