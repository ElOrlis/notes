# Why Study Cycles?

## Three General Areas

1. Trying to know more about the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities
   - Supply Chains, Supply & Demand Drivers, Credit Availability, Regulations, etc.
2. Being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for the participation\
   in those fundamentals
3. Understanding the investment environment we're in and deciding how to \
   strategically position our portfolios for it.

### What do value investors do?

- Strive to take advantage of discrepancies between "price" and "value"
  - Quantify an asset's intrinsic value and how it's likely to change over time
  - Assess how the current market price compares with the asset's intrinsic value\
     past prices for the asset, the prices of other assets, and \
    "theoretically fair" prices of the assets
